# ProbabilityProject
The study applies probability theory to understand how variables, such as temperature, evolve unpredictably over time, using assumptions like initial conditions and specific statistical characteristics for incremental changes.

# Part1A
This file uses monte carlo simulation to produce a graph for the proportion of temperatures above 0 for each time increment from [0, 1]. It can produce more than one graph based on the time increment and amount of times to run the simulation for a given time increment.
